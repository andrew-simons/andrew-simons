# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew Simons

🎓 MIT — Computer Science, Economics, & Data Science (6-14) + Mathematics (18)  

Welcome to my GitHub! I enjoy building projects at the intersection of **machine learning, mathematics, optimization, and real-world impact**.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🧠 QuestLog — Multiplayer Gamified Self-Improvement Platform  
**React · Node.js · Express · MongoDB · WebSockets · OAuth**  
Full-stack web application that turns habit formation into a **persistent, multiplayer game**. Users complete quests, earn XP and currency, customize shared rooms, and interact with friends in real time.  
Designed a hybrid architecture using **REST for durable state** (users, quests, inventory, rooms) and **WebSockets for ephemeral state** (presence, movement, actions), with explicit ownership rules to prevent state divergence across concurrent users.

### 📊 Machine-Learned Volatility & Time-Varying Monte Carlo Pricing  
**PyTorch · Python · NumPy · Pandas · Quant Finance**  
Trained a neural network to forecast **30-day forward realized volatility** using historical returns and rolling volatility features, outperforming a rolling-window benchmark out-of-sample.  
Integrated the model into a **time-varying Monte Carlo simulation**, re-estimating volatility at each step to generate path-dependent price dynamics and option price estimates with Monte Carlo standard errors.

### 🎵 Children’s Music Brigade App  
**Flutter · Firebase · Cloud Functions · PDF Generation**  
Cross-platform volunteer management system for a national nonprofit coordinating performances at hospitals and nursing homes.

### 📈 Market Sentiment ML Pipeline  
**LSTM · Random Forest · Logistic Regression · Python**  
End-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts short-term market sentiment from **50k+ social media posts**, including feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation.

### 🌐 More Coming Soon  
Machine learning research, quantitative finance tools, algorithmic trading experiments, and applied systems work.

If you're working on something interesting in **AI, quant finance, or applied systems**, feel free to reach out — I’m always excited to collaborate.
