## 📂 Featured Projects

### 📊 Machine-Learned Volatility & Time-Varying Monte Carlo Pricing  
**PyTorch · Python · NumPy · Pandas · Quant Finance**  
Trained a neural network to forecast **30-day forward realized volatility** using historical returns and rolling volatility features, outperforming a rolling-window benchmark out-of-sample.  
Integrated the model into a **time-varying Monte Carlo simulation**, re-estimating volatility at each step to generate path-dependent price dynamics and option price estimates with Monte Carlo standard errors.
